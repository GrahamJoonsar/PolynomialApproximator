# PolynomialApproximator
A way to generate a polynomial approximation for a function across some interval.

This function works by minimizing the area between a polynomial of the degree specified and the function one is trying to approximate across the interval provided. This approach works extremely well for periodic functions such as sine across the interval from zero to 2*pi.
